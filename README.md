Compatibility Calculator (JavaScript)**

Compatibility Calculator project implemented in JavaScript. This document provides an overview of the project's purpose, features, and instructions for usage.

### Overview
The Compatibility Calculator is a web-based application developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, designed to assess and visualize compatibility between two individuals based on user-defined criteria. This project provides a user-friendly and interactive way to evaluate compatibility for various purposes, such as matchmaking, team formation, or assessing interpersonal relationships.

Purpose
The primary purpose of the Compatibility Calculator is to facilitate the evaluation of compatibility 
The Compatibility Calculator is a web-based application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that allows users to assess compatibility between two individuals based on certain criteria or attributes. This calculator can be used for various purposes such as matchmaking, team-building, or compatibility analysis for friendships or relationships.

### Key Features

1. **Compatibility Assessment**: Evaluate the compatibility score between two individuals based on predefined criteria (e.g., personality traits, interests, preferences).

2. **Interactive Interface**: Provide an intuitive user interface for entering attributes and viewing compatibility results.

3. **Customizable Criteria**: Allow customization of compatibility criteria to adapt the calculator for different scenarios or user preferences.

4. **Visual Feedback**: Display compatibility results visually (e.g., using color-coded indicators or percentage scores) for easy interpretation.

### Usage

To use the Compatibility Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/anaumsharif/COMPATIBILITY-CALCULATOR-JAVASCRIPT.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```
   cd compatibility-calculator
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in a Web Browser**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

4. **Enter Attributes for Individuals**:
   - Input attributes or criteria for each individual into the form fields provided (e.g., personality traits, hobbies, preferences).
